# Instructions

To view the Webpage for the lab there are two options:

- View locally
  - I recommend using the Live Server VS Code extension and starting the server in the project root which should open the webpage automatically
- Using my GitHub pages link: https://jlevins189.github.io/Enterpise-App-Dev/Lab1/

### Improvements
