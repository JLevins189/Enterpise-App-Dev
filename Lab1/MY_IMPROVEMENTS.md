# My Improvements

## CSS

- I did not change the raw CSS too much as the template was already quite visually appealing.

- I stripped back a lot of the included CSS in favour of their Bootstrap class counterparts as I felt it made more sense in this context and tidied up the code a little by removing unnecessary CSS.

- I did add a media query in the about section for the big text that says "Born in 1987..." as it was not resposive at all on smaller screens and overflowed towards the edge of the screen and did not look good. However, the media query allowed me to keep this neat looking title while keeping it responsive.

- The layout has been changed in some areas which I will mention in the content and images section.

- I experimented with the background-image property however the pictures did not come out as clear as I'd hope. I wanted to create a background picture with text content above it.

## Content and Images

- The content provided on the template was a personal portfolio and in order to make this template work for this project, I decided to change a few sections in terms of layout to make the content and images look appealing and not out of place.

-I firstly removed a lot of buttons that didn't do anything.

- I then redone the header section by replacing images and names and the cursor text as well as changing the YouTube video in the modal. I chose to use iconic images that define a story the webpage tells.

- I then changed the big text in the about section. My vision was to create a story as you scroll through the website with emphasis on the big moments. I created a list of sections and made them one by one.

- I was a fan of the counter-up and icon checkmarks included in the template so decided to keep those and change the bullet points and numbers associated with them.

- A carousel was added for a cinematic effect on the beginning of the story. The images show the start of a journey, which this webpage is supposed to show.

- I then carried on the use of the checkmarks and icons into the next section while adding some new fitting icons to create a more visual experience to not bore the user with text.

- I decided the existing progress bars could be used to display something of proportions and variety so I chose sponsorships to go there. I did not like the second column layout for what I was trying to achieve, so I decided to try make something original visually. I used circular images contained within rows and columns with paddings and margins to create a "bubbles" effect using the images with different sizes. This was quite difficult to get right and even more difficult to make it work on smaller screens. I feel this adds to the visual side of the website and carrys a lot more weight than text. These images represent the topic they are part of and make things clear.

- I used accordions to show text that may or may not be that interesting so they were easy to skip over if required. They are an aesthetic way to convey content.

- The images that have a hover effect to show a button behind them was quite clever in the template, I had an idea of centered text over the images to show the meaning behind the images to visually convey a story. These images are like a highlights reel with a caption displayed on hover.

- For a table i decided to display a list of records, as opposed to a striped table I decided to split them up by topic using different background colours for each topic.

- I then finished the story with a happy ending in terms of content. The final image is the most iconic photo relating to the topic and shows raw emotion.

## JavaScript functionalities

- Due to a lot of the elements I used being interactive by nature such as accordion and carousel, I did not need to rely on my own JavaScript.

- For animations and effects I used Wow.js, CounterUp and JQuery.

- I designed this webpage with the principle "less is more" so replacing text with images that get the same message across and not overdoing functionality to the point it is distracting.

Some effects use JavaScript and the back to top button uses it to appear and disappear as required.

## Effects

For Effects, I used:

- JQuery
- Wow.js
- CounterUp.

With this template most of the effects were just content fading-in from the bottom of the screen.
I added a variety of animations that make the webpage feel more fluid and intuitive to use.
Some of the additions include one column sliding in left while the other slides in right to meet in the middle. Some stacks have one fading-in left and the next fading-in right.

## Why I selected this topic

Being a football fan my whole life and seeing one of the greatest ever growing up makes it something I am passionate about. Messi is also a very topical character due to the recent World Cup success.

### Final Note

Although it doesn't seem like a huge improvement, the template was already close to perfection and the finer details where what needed to be improved in order to create this webpage.
