# Lab 2

### To Execute Code:

1. Firstly, two terminals will be required.

2. Secondly, open the first terminal.

3. On the first terminal change your active directory to the "backend" subdirectory of this lab.

4. Install all dependencies for the backend using `npm i`

5. Use the command `node app.js` to start the server.

6. Keeping the first terminal open during the entirety over the server, on your 2nd terminal change your directory to the "frontend" subdirectory of this lab.

7. Install all dependencies for the frontend using `npm i`

8. In your second terminal issue the command `npm start` to start the React development server. This should start your browser automatically to the web server port 3000, if not in your browser go to `localhost:3000`

### Discrepancies in completed parts due to selected technologies

As agreed I used React, Axios, Express as opposed to jQuery. My Node server did not serve an index.html from the root as I was using React and used a separate dev server on a different port to do this.
A variation of a 2D array was used (a merged array of objects)

"In addition to the previous functionalities, include several buttons that use jQuery
to modify the properties of the website" - jQuery is not being used but React was used with buttons to modify website properties.

"Use JQUERY to enable the user to select a specific cell of the table and change
its colour once it is selected like in here" - again not using jQuery but done using React
